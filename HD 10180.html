            HD 10180, also designated 2MASS J01375356-6030414,
            is a Sun-like star in the southern constellation Hydrus that is notable for its large planetary system. <br>
            Since its discovery, at least six exoplanets have been observed orbiting it, and some studies have proposed
            up to
            nine potential planets, <br>
            which would make it potentially the largest of all known planetary systems, including the Solar System. <br>

            HD 10180 b is a possible Earth-sized planet (minimum mass 1.3 times Earth's) located at 0.02 AU. Its orbital
            radius was originally estimated to have a near-circular orbit at a distance of 0.02225 ± 0.00035 AU (closer
            than Mercury, about one-seventh the distance and correspondingly hotter), taking 1.1 days to complete a full
            orbit. The estimated parameters of planet b were revised in 2012 with a slightly smaller orbital radius
            and a more eccentric orbit. The false detection probability was initially 1.4%; its probability was
            improved by Mikko Tuomi in 2012, but it was not confirmed by subsequent studies, such as Kane in 2014.

            HD 10180 c, with a minimum mass comparable to that of Uranus, is a hot Neptune. Dynamical simulations
            suggest that if the mass gradient was any more than a factor of two, the system would not be stable. Its
            orbital period and eccentricity were originally estimated at 5.75979 ± 0.00062 and 0.045 ± 0.026
            respectively; however, these were revised in 2012 in favour of a more eccentric orbit. The false detection
            probability is less than 0.1%.

            HD 10180 i is a possible but unconfirmed hot super-Earth claimed by Mikko Tuomi in 2012. Subsequent
            studies have not confirmed it.

            HD 10180 d is a hot Neptune. Its mass was initially estimated at >11.75 ± 0.65 Earth masses (smaller than
            Uranus) and on a slightly eccentric orbit; however, this was re-estimated with a larger mass and less
            eccentric orbit in 2012.

            HD 10180 e is thought to be a hot Neptune with about twice the mass of Neptune. Its estimated orbital
            distance and eccentricity were downscaled in 2012. The false detection probability is less than 0.1%.

            HD 10180 j is a possible but unconfirmed hot super-Earth or gas dwarf claimed by Mikko Tuomi in 2012.
            Subsequent studies have not confirmed it.

            HD 10180 f is a hot Neptune and similar in mass to HD 10180 e. At an orbital distance of 0.49 AU and
            eccentricity of 0.12, its orbit is analogous to that of Mercury with a similar black-body-temperature range,
            though with its high mass, any greenhouse effect caused by an atmosphere would give it searing Venus-like or
            greater temperatures. Its estimated orbital distance and eccentricity were downscaled slightly in 2012. The
            false detection probability is less than 0.1%.

            HD 10180 g is a giant planet with a mass larger than Neptune's. It has a significantly eccentric orbit
            at 1.4 AU and either crosses the system's predicted habitable zone or lies within it though it does
            not fit current models for planetary habitability due to its large mass (at least 23 times Earth). If it is
            a gas giant, it is likely of Sudarsky Class II. There is a possibility that a natural satellite with
            sufficient atmospheric pressure could have liquid water on its surface. Its estimated orbital distance and
            eccentricity were downscaled in 2012 but remains in the habitable zone. The false detection probability is
            less than 0.1%.

            HD 10180 h is the largest and outermost known planet in the system. Originally, it was thought to be a
            Saturn-sized giant planet with a minimum mass 65 times that of Earth, though this minimum mass has since
            been revised downward to 46 Earth masses. Orbiting at 3.4 AU, a distance comparable to the distance of
            the outer part of the asteroid belt from the Sun and as such it is likely a Sudarsky Class I planet. The
            spurious detection probability is 0.6%.
