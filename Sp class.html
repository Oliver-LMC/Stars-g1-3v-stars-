            In astronomy,
            stellar classification is the classification of stars based on their spectral characteristics. <br>
            Electromagnetic radiation from the star is analyzed by splitting it with a prism or diffraction grating into
            a spectrum exhibiting the rainbow of colors interspersed with spectral lines. <br>
            Each line indicates a particular chemical element or molecule, <br>
            with the line strength indicating the abundance of that element. <br>
            The strengths of the different spectral lines vary mainly due to the temperature of the photosphere, <br>
            although in some cases there are true abundance differences.
            The spectral class of a star is a short code primarily summarizing the ionization state, <br>
            giving an objective measure of the photosphere's temperature. <br>

            Most stars are currently classified under the Morganâ€“Keenan (MK) system using the letters O, B, A, F, G, K,
            and M, a sequence from the hottest (O type) to the coolest (M type). <br>
            Each letter class is then subdivided using a numeric digit with 0 being hottest and 9 being coolest (e.g.,
            A8, A9, F0, and F1 form a sequence from hotter to cooler). <br>
            The sequence has been expanded with classes for other stars and star-like objects that do not fit in the
            classical system, such as class D for white dwarfs and classes S and C for carbon stars. <br>
